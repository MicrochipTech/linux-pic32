* Microchip PIC32 Pinmux device.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt for details of the pinctrl properties and
common bindings.

PIC32 'pin configuration node' is a node of a group of pins which can be
used for a specific device or function. This node represents configuraions of
single pins or a pairs of mux and related configuration.

Required properties for pic32 device:
 - compatible: "microchip,pic32-pinctrl", "microchip,pic32mz-pinctrl"
 - reg: Base address and length for pps:in and pps:out registers.

Properties for 'pin configuration node':
 - pic32,pins: each entry consists of 3 intergers and represents the mux and
   config settings for one pin. The first integer represent the remappable pin,
   the second represent the peripheral pin and the last the configuration.
   The format is pic32,pins = <PIC32_RP_'dir'_'pin'
   PIC32_PP_'dir'_'peripherl-pin' PIC32_PIN_CONF_'config'>. The configurations
   are divided in 2 classes: IN and OUT and each in 4 buckets. Each entry must
   contains items from the same class and bucket, otherwise the driver will
   notify an error and the initialization will fail.
 - pic32,single-pins: each entry consists of 3 intergers and represents a pin
   (that is not remappable) and related configuraion. The format is
   pic32,single-pins = <PORT_'x' 'pin' PIC32_PIN_CONF_'config'>. Each port has
   32 pins and please refer to chip documentation for details of remappable
   pins.

Available pin configurations (refer to dt-bindings/pinctrl/pic32.h):
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_NONE	: no configuration (default).
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_OD	: indicate this pin need a open-drain (no direction).
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_OD_OUT	: indicate this pin need a open-drain out.
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_PU	: indicate this pin need a pull up (no direction).
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_PU_IN	: indicate this pin need a pull up in.
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_PD	: indicate this pin need a pull down (no direction).
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_PD_IN	: indicate this pin need a pull down input.
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_AN	: indicate this pin as analogic (no direction).
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_AN_IN	: indicate this pin as analogic input.
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_DG	: indicate this pin as digital (no direction).
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_DG_IN	: indicate this pin as digital input.
	PIC32_PIN_CONF_DG_OUT	: indicate this pin as digital output.

NOTEs:
1. The pins functions nods are defined under pic32 pinctrl node. The function's
   pin groups are defined under functions node.
2. Each pin group can have both pic32,pins and pic32,single-pins properties to
   specify re-mappable or non-remappable pins with related mux and configs or
   at least one.
3. Each pin configuration node can have a phandle and devices can set pins
   configurations by referring to the phandle of that pin configuration node.
4. The pinctrl bindings are listed in dt-bindings/pinctrl/pic32.h.
5. The gpio controller must be described in the pinctrl simple-bus.

Example:
pinctrl@1f800000{
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	compatible = "microchip,pic32-pinctrl", "simple-bus";
	ranges;
	reg = <0x1f801404 0x3c>, /* in  */
	      <0x1f801538 0x57>; /* out */

	pioA: gpio@1f860000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-gpio";
		reg = <0x1f860000 0x24>;
		gpio-controller;
	};

	/* functions */
	sw1 {
		pinctrl_sw1: sw1-0 {
			pic32,single-pins = <PORT_B 12 PIC32_PIN_CONF_PULLUP>;
		};
	};

	uart1 {
		pinctrl_uart1: uart1-0 {
			pic32,pins =
				<PIC32_RP_OUT_RPG7 PIC32_PP_OUT_U1TX PIC32_PIN_CONF_NONE
				 PIC32_RP_IN_RPG8 PIC32_PP_IN_U1RX PIC32_PIN_CONF_NONE>;
		};
	};
};

uart1: serial@1f822000 {
	compatible = "microchip,pic32-uart";

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_uart1>;
};

sw@1 {
	compatible = "microchip,pic32-switch";

	interrupt-parent = <&pioB>;
	interrupts = <12 PIC32_CN_RISING>;/* GPIO_B_12 */

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_sw1>;
};
