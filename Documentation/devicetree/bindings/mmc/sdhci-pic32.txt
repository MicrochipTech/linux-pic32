* Microchip PIC32 SDHCI Controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-pic32 driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "microchip,pic32-sdhci"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt
- pinctrl: Should contain pinctrl for data and command lines

Optional properties:
- no-1-8-v: 1.8V voltage selection not supported
- piomode: disable DMA support

Example:

	sdhci@1f8ec000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-sdhci";
		reg = <0x1f8ec000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <SDHC_EVENT DEFAULT_INT_PRI IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&REFCLKO4>, <&PBCLK5>;
		clock-names = "base_clk", "sys_clk";
	};
