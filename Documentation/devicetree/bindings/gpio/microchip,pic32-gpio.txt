* Microchip PIC32 GPIO devices (PIO).

Required properties:
 - compatible: "microchip,pic32-gpio"
 - reg: Base address and length for the device.
 - interrupts: The port interrupt shared be all pins.
 - gpio-controller: Marks the port as GPIO controller.
 - #gpio-cells: Two. The first cell is the pin number and
   the second cell is unused.
 - interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
 - #interrupt-cells: Two. The first cell is the GPIO number and second cell
   is used to specify the trigger type:
	PIC32_PIN_CN_RISING	: low-to-high edge triggered.
	PIC32_PIN_CN_FALLING	: high-to-low edge triggered.
	PIC32_PIN_CN_BOTH	: low-to-high and high-to-low edges triggered.

Note:
 - If gpio-ranges is missing, then all the pins (32) related to the gpio bank
   are enabled.

Example:
	pioA: gpio@1f860000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-gpio";
		reg = <0x1f860000 0x24>;
		interrupts = <PORTA_INPUT_CHANGE_INTERRUPT
				DEFAULT_INT_PRI IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		gpio-controller;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		gpio-ranges = <&pic32_pinctrl 0 0 32>;
		clocks = <&PBCLK4>;
	};
