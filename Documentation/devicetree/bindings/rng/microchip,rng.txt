PIC32 Random number generator

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "microchip,pic32-rng"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- clocks: clock phandle.

Example:

rng {
        compatible = "microchip,pic32-rng";
	reg = <0x1f8e6000 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&PBCLK5>;
};
