Microchip PIC32 Real Time Clock

Required properties:
- compatible: should be: "microchip,pic32-rtc"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- interrupts: rtc alarm/event interrupt
- clocks: rtc clock

Example:

	rtc@1f8c0000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-rtc";
		reg = <0x1f8c0000 0x60>;
		interrupts = <REAL_TIME_CLOCK DEFAULT_INT_PRI
				IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		clocks = <&PBCLK6>;
	};
