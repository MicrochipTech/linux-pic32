PIC32 SoC I2S Driver

Required properties:
- compatible : "microchip,pic32-i2s"
- reg : Should contain I2S registers location (physical address) and length
- interrupts : Should contain I2S receive and transmit interrupts
- dmas : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../dma/dma.txt for details.
- dma-names : Must include the following entries:
  - rx
  - tx
- clocks : Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.

Example:

	i2s0: i2s@1f821000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-i2s";
		reg = <0x1f821000 512>;
		interrupts = <SPI1_RECEIVE_DONE DEFAULT_INT_PRI IRQ_TYPE_NONE>,
			<SPI1_TRANSFER_DONE DEFAULT_INT_PRI IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		dmas = <&dma 0>,
			<&dma 1>;
		dma-names = "rx", "tx";
		clocks = <&PBCLK2>;
	};
