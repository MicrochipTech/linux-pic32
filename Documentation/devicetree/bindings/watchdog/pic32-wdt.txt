* PIC32 Watchdog Timer

** pic32-wdt

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "microchip,pic32-wdt-v2".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- clocks: phandle of source clk. should be <&LPRC> clk. v2 can have clock
  other than <&LPRC>.

Example:

	watchdog: wdt@bf800800 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-wdt";
		reg = <0x1f800800 0x200>;
		clocks = <&LPRC>;
	};
