* PIC32 Pulse Width Modulation

PWM functionality in Microchip PIC32 SoC is driven by Output Compare(OCMP)
module. OCMP module in congruence with General Purpose Timer(TIMER) module
generates PWM signal.

In PWM mode OCMP generates HIGH during duty_cycle and LOW when timer.count
exceeds duty_cycle. OCMP reloads duty_cycle when timer.count reaches PERIOD
and continues to drive HIGH.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "microchip,pic32-pwm"
- #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format. The only third cell flag supported by this binding is
  PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED.
- microchip,timer: pbtimer phandle.
- microchip,ocmp: ocmp phandle

Example:

pwm@0 {
	compatible = "microchip,pic32-pwm";
	microchip,timer = <&PBTIMER6>; /* pbtimer phandle */
	microchip,ocmp = <&OCMP2>; /* ocmp phandle */
};
