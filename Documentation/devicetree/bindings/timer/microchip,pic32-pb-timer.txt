Microchip PIC32 general purpose timer

The PIC32 timer module provides one class-A 16-bit timer and eight 16-bit class-B free
running counter. Two consecutive 16-bit timers can be combined to form one
32-bit timer.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be one of the followings
	"microchip,pic32-timer"      16-bit class-B timer.
	"microchip,pic32-timerA"	16-bit class-A timer
	"microchip,pic32-timer32"	32-bit class-B timer
	"microchip,pic32-timer-adc"	16-bit ADC event trigger timer.
- reg : Specifies base address and size of the registers.
- interrupts : See evic ../interrupt-controller/.
- clocks : Must contain one entry, for the module clock.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- timer-id: timer id (starting at 1) as documented in FRM.

Optional properties:
- microchip,timer-A : added only for class-A timer.
- microchip,timer-async : asynchronous clock source.
- microchip,timer-32bit : timer support 32bit counting.
- microchip,timer-gated : gated timer
- microchip,timer-adc : timer can trigger an ADC.
- microchip,timer-oneshot: one-shot timer, instead of continuous.
- microchip,timer-version: set timer version (default 1).
- clock-frequency : default timer rate, see ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- microchip,clock-indices: See ../clocks/microchip,pic32-clock.txt


Example:

pbtimer4:pbtimer4 {
	#timer-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "microchip,pic32-timer";
	reg = <0xbf840600 0x400>;
	interrupts = <0>;
	clocks = <&PBCLK3>, <&TxCKI>;
	timer-id = <4>;
	microchip,timer-32bit; /* class B, 32-bit combined timer; usable for ADC */
	microchip,timer-adc;
	clock-frequency = <200000000>; /* 200MHZ */
};

The timer consumers should specify the desire timer by having the timer in its
"pic32,timer" phandle cell. For example for PWM

pwm-0: {
	compatible = <>;
	microchip,timer = <&pbtimer4>; /* pbtimer phandle */
};
