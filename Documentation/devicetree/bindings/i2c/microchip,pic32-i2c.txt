* Microchip PIC32 I2C Bus Driver

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "microchip,pic32-i2c"
- reg: Should contain the address & size of the I2C controller registers.
- interrupts: Should specify the interrupt provided by parent.
- clocks: Should contain a single clock specifier for the JZ4780 I2C clock.
- clock-frequency: desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.

Recommended properties:
- pinctrl-names: should be "default";
- pinctrl-0: phandle to pinctrl function

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle of the interrupt controller that
  delivers interrupts to the I2C block.

Example:

	i2c1: i2c@1f820000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-i2c";
		reg = <0x1f820000 512>;
		interrupts = <I2C1_MASTER_EVENT DEFAULT_INT_PRI
				IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
		clocks = <&PBCLK2>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_i2c1>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		wm8731: wm8731@1a {
                        compatible = "wlf,wm8731";
                        reg = <0x1a>;
                };

		ak4953a: ak4953a@12 {
			compatible = "asahi-kasei,ak4953a";
			reg = <0x12>;
			reset-gpio = <&pioH 3 0>;
		};
	};
