* PIC32 Ethernet Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "microchip,pic32-ec"
- reg: Address and length of the register-set (and optional,
       coherent-memory-region) for the device.
- reg-name: name of above "reg" property name. It must have "regs". Add
            "mem" if optional coherent-memory-region is available.
- interrupts: Should contain ethernet interrupt
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- clock-names: Single clock names.
	Required elements: 'eth_clk'
- clocks: Phandle to clock.

Optional properties:
- local-mac-address: Static MAC address.

Examples:

	pic32_ether: ethernet@1f882000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-ec";
		reg = <0x1f882000 0x1000>,<0x1000 0x7f000>;
		reg-name= "regs","mem";
		interrupts = <ETHERNET_INTERRUPT DEFAULT_INT_PRI IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phy-mode = "rmii";
		local-mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		clock-names = "eth_clk";
		clocks = <&PBCLK5>;
	};
